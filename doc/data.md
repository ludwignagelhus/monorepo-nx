## Persistant data

TODO

Figure out how to persist data.
What to persist?

- game configs per player
- table configs per player

- private groups/home games

- hand history
- tournament results
- tournament configs

- default cash game configs

  - a set of default configs to use for lobby games open to all
  - auto adjust number of tables to players online (ie. remove empty tables, and add tables when all tables are full)

- users
- balances

- account bans?
  but is really easy to create new account :<
